The program utilizes Tkinter to provide a GUI for analyzing where shots have hit a target. It uses statistical methods to estimate how succesful a given test, like hitting 9 shots out of 10, will be. The analysis typically provides a far more accurate assessment than simply using the binomial theorem based on the accuracy, as well as error bounds.
